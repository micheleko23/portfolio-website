        <h1> Creating my Portfolio Site </h1>

      </div>

      <div>

        <div>
          <h2> The Brief </h2>
          <p> As part of my pivot from law to a more design and technology-related role, and with a goal to eventually manage products, I wanted to learn how to read and write front end code so that I would be a useful asset to a company’s product design team. I want to be able to implement my own designs through code and be familiar with the possibilities and limits of the coding languages that software developers will be using on my teams. I believe my previous experience in the corporate world, my UX/UI design work and my newly acquired knowledge of front end web development will help me become an effective product manager who can balance the requests and needs of the various members of the product design team. </p>
          <p> I also need to have a portfolio to show to future employers. I therefore signed up to a “Frontend Development for Designers” course with Career Foundry to learn how to write HTML, CSS and Javascript. I used these skills to build this portfolio website from scratch to display my projects and information about myself. Knowledge of frontend development will also give me the opportunity to express myself and create my own designs.   </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2> The Goal </h2>
          <p>To showcase my UI/UX projects, learn how to write and read HTML, CSS and Javascript (libraries and plugins), learn about responsive design considerations using media queries, learn how to use text editors, linters and color accessibility checkers, experience user testing and iterations on portfolio functions based on feedback and experimenting with interaction design and animation. </p>

        </div>


        <div>
          <h2> The Process </h2>
          <h3> Research </h3>
          <p> I started the process by looking up top UX/UI portfolios online to get a sense of the type of content that is usually included on portfolio sites. It became clear that these sites all had a clear header/hero section, projects easily accessible on the landing page and a section with interesting facts about the designer. </p>
        </div>


        <div>
          <h3> Content </h3>
          <p> I proceeded to write out the content for the website so that I would be able to better visualize the placement of each component. This included an introductory/hero section, a short summary of my projects, a detailed page for each project and a summary about my experiences, interests and skills/tools. </p>
            </div>

<div>
            <h3> Layouts </h3>
            <p> I wanted the site to be straightforward and simple so that users will be able to find the information they are looking for as quickly and as easily as possible. I opted for a site map that consisted of a home page, an about page and separate project pages (linked from the home page), with contact details available on the footer of each page. </p>
            </div>

              <div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-lg-5">
              <h3> Building a style - Typography and Color </h3>
              <p> In terms of typography, I wanted a fresh, playful and artistic theme, and tried to obtain a similar feeling with the color scheme. I also made sure buttons were in a bright color so that they stand out as call-to-actions. </p>
              </div>

        <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-7">
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/portfoliosite/typography.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img src="img/portfoliosite/typography.png" alt="Typography Portfolio">
          </picture>
        </div>
</div>


<div>
  <h3> Logo </h3>
  <p> I started out by sketching variations of my initials and my full name but nothing really stood out to me. I then decided to start drawing out my interests because I wanted the logo to reflect my personality. I ended up thinking about how I wanted to combine my interest in health & wellness, my experience as a lawyer and my future career as a designer. I combined icons from these three and created the letter “K” for my last initial out of a dumbbell icon, a pencil icon and a gavel icon. I tried incorporating icons into the first initial “M”, however this looked slightly too busy. I went with the current design so that the “M” is clear, with “K” as the icon incorporating my interests/experiences. </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3> Coding </h3>
    <p> I then put the content I typed up into HTML form for each page. Then I added the CSS styling to achieve my desired typography and color, and create responsive design elements for desktop, tablet and phone screens with media queries. Afterwards I added some Javascript to certain elements in my site to add more interactivity. </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3> User Testing </h3>
    <p> I created a usability test for 5 users and iterated on my site based on the useful feedback. I then used a color accessibility checker and code checker to fix any remaining errors. </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2> The Result </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-5">
        <h3> Landing page  </h3>
        <p> In my research, I saw a lot of portfolios had quite a large “Hello” hero section, so I wanted to include a similar version in mine as well as I felt it gave off a welcoming impression. I liked the separation of the top and bottom borders around my hero section as it adds some interest to the header but also maintains a sense of minimalism/professionalism.
I dive straight into my work section on the home page, showcasing summaries of each project and the skills/tools used so that users can get a sense of the range of work that I have without needing to go into each detailed project page. There is a bright blue “view project” button so that users are able to see very quickly that there are more detailed case studies for each project.
In terms of navigation, the logo is in the top left corner, as is standard on similar websites. Clicking on this will bring the user back to the home page. The navigation bar is on the right (and this turns into a hamburger menu on smaller viewports), with the “Contact” button leading to the footer section of the relevant page that the user is on. CSS animations are also used on the navigation bar to add interest.

        <h3> About page  </h3>
        <p> I wanted to ensure the design stayed consistent throughout the portfolio website, so I kept the header design and also stuck with the two-column layout on the “About” page. I also included a button for users to see my CV for more information.    </p>

<p> This contact footer is on the bottom of every page, with clickable links for the user to send me an email and to open up my LinkedIn profile. I’ve made the footer the same color as the header – a muted/pastel pink – to ensure consistency, and also to make my contact details eye-catching. </p>      </div>
