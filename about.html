          <h2> Background </h2>
          <p> I currently live in Singapore but I am originally from Hong Kong and have also lived in the United Kingdom for 6 years.
            I studied law and worked as a corporate lawyer in Singapore and London, but ever since high school I have always had an innate passion for the intersection of design and technology, and signed up to graphic design and 3D CAD subjects in
            high school, summer school and related extracurricular activities whenever possible throughout school and university. I discovered UX design in 2019 and believe that becoming an interaction designer would be the ideal job for me due to
            the combination of design thinking, psychology and empathy, and have since taken multiple courses to gain experience and transition into the field.
          </p>
          <h3> Interests </h3>
          <p>
            I have a keen interest in health and wellness and am studying to obtain a nutrition certification in my free time. You will frequently find me at gym studios across the city trying out a range of random workouts.
            I am also learning to play the ukulele and I love playing board games and video games with family and friends, especially if it is a competitive round of Overcooked. </p>

          <h3> Relevant Skills </h3>
          <ul>
            <li> Empathetic and friendly – Sensitive to the feelings of the people around me, and interested in learning about the origins, thought process and reasoning behind their emotions. In UX design, this has helped me
              foresee user frustrations and create better and more enjoyable experiences. </li>
            <li> Collaborative and social – Naturally a bubbly and social person with significant project-based experience working in a team. I enjoy the camaraderie of group work, and am very receptive to taking in
              feedback and reiterating on work products. </li>
            <li> Client management – As an ex-lawyer, I am able to multitask and manage expectations and maintain good relations among many stakeholders at a time. I have also interacted with a variety of international clients and have become
              culturally aware of when work style needs to be adapted to suit different types of clients or team members. </li>
            <li> Experienced researcher - Trained to sift through and analyze vast quantities of data, information and documents in a short amount of time to highlight important issues and considerations for clients.</li>
