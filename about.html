          <h2> My Story </h2>
          <h3> Background </h3>
          <p> I currently live in Singapore but I am originally from Hong Kong and have also lived in the United Kingdom for 6 years.
I studied law and worked as a corporate lawyer in Singapore and London, but ever since high school I have always had an innate passion for the intersection of design and technology, and signed up to graphic design and 3D CAD subjects in high school, summer school and related extracurricular activities whenever possible throughout school and university. I discovered UX design in 2019 and believe that becoming an interaction designer would be the ideal job for me due to the combination of design thinking, psychology and empathy, and have since taken multiple courses to gain experience and transition into the field.
 </p>
 <h3> Fun facts </h3>
 <p>
<ul>

  <li> I have a keen interest in health and wellness and am studying to obtain a nutrition certification in my free time. After work you will find me at gym studios across the city trying out a range of random workouts! </li>
  <li>I am learning to play the ukulele. </li>
  <li>I love playing board games and video games with family and friends, especially playing a competitive round of Overcooked. </li>
    </ul>

          <h2> Skills and Tools </h2>
          <div>
            <h3> Relevant Skills </h3>
            <u1>
              <li> Empathetic and friendly – I have always been sensitive to the feelings of the people around me, and am interested in learning about the origins, thought process and reasoning behind their emotions. In UX design, this has helped me foresee user frustrations and create better and more enjoyable experiences.  </li>
              <li> Collaborative and social – I am naturally a bubbly and social person, and my previous job was project-based so I have plenty of experience working in a team. I enjoy the camaraderie of group work, and am very receptive to taking in feedback and reiterating on work products. </li>
              <li> Client management – As an ex-lawyer, I am able to multitask and manage expectations and maintain good relations among many stakeholders at a time. I have also interacted with a variety of international clients and have become culturally aware of when work style needs to be adapted to suit different types of clients or team members. </li>
